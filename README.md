# Talon Game Engine
_by Ravern Koh_

Talon engine is a cross-platform game engine which runs on macOS, Linux and Windows platforms. It uses inline SVG to render its graphics. It is a simple, relatively unoptimized game engine coded in spare time as a hobby, with the philosophy of _foundation first, optimization later_.

## Requirements

- An open mind.
- A knowledge of Vector graphics
